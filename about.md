Meta-site for Matthew Aguirre.  There's not much going on here but pointers to projects and other sites.

I am a Software Engineer with bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from Virginia Tech.  Just about the only thing that I think computers can't do is think.  I'm pretty much an "AI ain't going to happen" kind of guy.  That is, AI in a general sense, of having a computer that can think like a person.  However, specialized AI is possible within a narrow domain.

I wear all the hats!  Being the lone programmer at a company, I get to maintain all servers/services, design, code, test, and fix all projects.  Any database work that needs to be done; that's me too.  Work is mostly Linux with Java.  Sometimes I get to push Python.  I have migrated most products from Windows to Linux; C# to Java, VSS to svn and GitHub, IIS to Apache.

Linux is the desktop.  I haven't used Windows on bare-metal Since XP and I had a MacBook Pro when they first came out on Intel chips.  I like the feel of OS X, but now I don't think I'd buy one again.

One day I plan to go back to Tech and get a PhD (as in, when I retire).
