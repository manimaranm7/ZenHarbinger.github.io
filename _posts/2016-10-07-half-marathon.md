I had previously stated that I was running the [Prince William Half Marathon](http://www.princewilliamhalf.com/).

[Well, I finished!](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/29204/IndividualResult/XgLB?remMeAttempt=#U4637414)

This was definitely one of the hardest things I've done, but it wasn't quite as difficult as I thought it would be at the same time.  Months of prep and a cool day really helped, but I was pretty out of it for the rest of the day.  Also, race day is alway easier; running with a bunch of people is different than running alone.  Next year I'll probably try again, maybe even stay for some post-race activities.

Enjoying a beer at the end of the race.  Thanks [Old Bust Head](https://www.oldbusthead.com/)!
