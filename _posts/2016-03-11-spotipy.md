[Spotipy](https://github.com/ZenHarbinger/spotipy) is a music player that plays spotify and local files.  This project was created to provide playback of local files other than mp3 in spotify (FLAC).  This project uses gstreamer so any file type with the appropriate plugin should work.  Work on this project is halted due to no longer having a spotify subscription, but the local file playback functionality has recently been updated and is functional (to varying definitions of functional).
